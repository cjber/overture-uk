_Scraping Overture data for specific brands_

As discussed in the main body, extracting a complete list of POIs for a brand (e.g., Waitrose) is difficult due to missing values in the category and brand columns. For example, selecting all POIs by brand, as below in Figure i, results in 0 POIs for Waitrose, and 1,934 POIs for Spar.

However, by integrating additional filters, specifically on the POI name and the POI category columns, you can get to the final list of POIs for each retail brand, which closely resemble those in the Geolytix dataset. For example, in Figure ii we show that the brand and name columns need to be filtered to extract all Spar supermarket stores, and name and category columns need to be filtered to extract all Waitrose supermarkets (excluding petrol stations and other retail formats). This code snippet (Figure ii) results in 420 POIs for Waitrose, and 2,308 POIs for Spar, as in Table 1. This has strong implications for future use of this dataset, where users should consider POI name, brand and category if seeking to extract a complete list of POIs for specific research questions or applications.
